## Game rules
* One player is selected as the 'artist.'  They must try to draw the word that they are given.
* The other players have to guess what the artist is trying to draw, and type their guess into the box on their screen.
* If a player guesses correctly, the artist and that player are both awarded points, and a new word is chosen.
* After 60 seconds, the round is over, and a new artist is selected at random.
